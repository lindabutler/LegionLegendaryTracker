
Track kills for:
   Dungeon bosses (normal, heroic, mythic)   // Statistics only counts end boss kills on all three difficulties. ex: Cordana
    Raid bosses                              // Statistics counts each boss on all 4 difficulty levels World bosses
    World bosses                             //track through WQs?
    Emissary Caches (rewarded after completing 4 world quests) //WQ Trigger?
    Rated Arena wins                         //statistics
    Rated/Unrated Battleground wins          //statistics
    PvP Strongboxes                          //??
    Mythic+ Weekly Caches                    //??
    mythic+ chests end of run                //??
    Rare mobs                                //monsterID? some way of knowing wheteher you've killed it before (silver)
    Treasures (legion)                       //id? handynotes knows what treasures you've found... 

Also should show total chances on current track count.

UI Interface Buttons: 
   save button with box/dropdown to set which legendary number this is? 
     and checkbox for partial count (chances before addon installed). 
     reset button (are you sure?) 
     chose what you're tracking (so you don't show normals to 110s, arenas to those who never pvp, etc.)

Database: send number of attempts taken back to database (per individual category; give it to mathy people?)

Caveats: 
    assumes if you killed a dungeon end boss, you killed all the other boses in the dungeon
    not tracking mythic return to karazhan at the moment since mount runs won't trigger and many bosses get skipped
    blingatron 6000 should be added to... world treasure pool?
